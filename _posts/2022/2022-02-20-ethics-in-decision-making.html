    Lapses in ethics by engineers have led to disastrous outcomes. As a result, the engineering community is in consensus that ethics is integral to the engineering discipline. To enforce ethical principles, many engineering organizations have outlined guidelines of ethical practices. As such, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has outlined ethical practices for the software engineering community.

    This paper evaluates the influence of ACM's code of ethics on software engineering decision-making. The paper surveyed software engineers and students with 11 ethical decisions from real incidents. The paper concludes that ACM’s code of ethics does not have an observable effect on the participants’ decision-making. This finding poses the question that if a code of ethics cannot be used to guide ethical decision-making, what could?

    An interesting suggestion from the paper is that news story anecdotes could influence ethical decision-making. This suggestion inspires an idea to use news stories as a tool to learn from engineering failures.

    Ethical decisions in software development can substantially impact end-users, organizations, and our environment, as is evidenced by recent ethics scandals in the news. Organizations, like the ACM, publish codes of ethics to guide software-related ethical decisions. In fact, the ACM has recently demonstrated renewed interest in its code of ethics and made updates for the first time since 1992. To better understand how the ACM code of ethics changes software-related decisions, we replicated a prior behavioral ethics study with 63 software engineering students and 105 professional software developers, measuring their responses to 11 ethical vignettes. We found that explicitly instructing participants to consider the ACM code of ethics in their decision making had no observed effect when compared with a control group. Our findings suggest a challenge to the research community: if not a code of ethics, what techniques can improve ethical decision making in software engineering?
